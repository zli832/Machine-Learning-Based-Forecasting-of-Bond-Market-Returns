# Machine-Learning-Based-Forecasting-of-Bond-Market-Returns

Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to forecast bond market returns. Unlike stocks, bonds are harder to predict because they don't trade as openly and price information is less available. We use different machine learning models to forecast which bonds will give better returns.

Goals

- Predict how the corporate bond index will perform
- Compare different machine learning approaches
- Figure out what factors matter most for bond returns
- Help with making better investment decisions

How It Works
We test several different machine learning methods:

Random Forest and LightGBM 

Bond details: 
observation_date, return level,continously compounded annual rate of change, continuously compounded rate of change, change from year ago, change, natural log of change, percent change from year ago, compounded annual rate of change, percent change, year, month, day, log return of change, 1-day lagged return, 2-day lagged return, 3-day lagged return, 5-day lagged return, 10-day lagged return, 1-day moving average, 3-day moving average, moving average difference, 3-day volatility, 5-day volatility, 4-period exponentially weighted volatility, rsi(relatively strength index)
